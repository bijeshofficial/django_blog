# Django Blog

This is a Python Personal Project I did so I can further enhance my concepts in django framework. 

The primary purpose of doing this project is to be familiar with:

* CRUD operations
* Databases and Authentication System
* Accept user inputs from forms
* Send email to reset passwords

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages.

```bash
cd to the directory where requirements.txt is located
activate your virtualenv
run: pip install requirements.txt
```

<!-- ## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
``` -->
